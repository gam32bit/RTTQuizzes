#Round the Triangle - Monthly Quizzes

Welcome to the repository for the "Round the Triangle" Monthly Quizzes! This project is a simple, interactive quiz website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's designed to be easily customizable, allowing you to create your own quizzes on any topic.

## How It Works

The website consists of a main home page that displays a gallery of available quizzes. Each quiz is loaded dynamically from a JSON file, making it easy to add, remove, or update quizzes without modifying the HTML.

When a user selects a quiz, they are taken to a quiz page where the questions and options are presented one at a time. The user's answers are checked against the correct answers stored in the JSON file, and a score is displayed at the end.
