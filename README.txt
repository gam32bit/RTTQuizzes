#Website featuring interactive monthly quizzes for the Round the Triangle newsletter

## Getting Started

- I talked with ChatGPT to brainstorm how to go about this project and how to structure the repo. 
- I created on a repo on GitHub as well as the starting files and folders.
- ChatGPT's initial suggestions for CSS look good, got the card format the way I wanted.
- Figured out how to link button to quiz page and how to get it to load json file with monthly quiz info
- Javascript is loading for quiz page, and highlights work to show correct and incorrect answers, but additional context doesn't show.
