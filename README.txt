#Website featuring interactive monthly quizzes for the Round the Triangle newsletter

## Getting Started

- I talked with ChatGPT to brainstorm how to go about this project and how to structure the repo. 
- I created on a repo on GitHub as well as the starting files and folders.
- ChatGPT's initial suggestions for CSS look good, got the card format the way I wanted.
- Figured out how to link button to quiz page and how to get it to load json file with monthly quiz info
- Got Javascript to load for quiz page, which involved adding html elements to the quiz page
- highlights work to show correct and incorrect answers, and additional context by adding html element (is this best solution?)
- Got visual feedback to stop after first selection by adding a "flag" which is a boolean that checks is an answer has been selected and then removes event listeners
